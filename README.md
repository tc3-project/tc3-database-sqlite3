# The Caribbean Coffee Company ![](./.common/logo.png?raw=true)
by Joel Mussman<br/>
original project concept by Joel Mussman and Justin Poole 

The Caribbean Coffee Company (TC3) is a cafe-operations project that was developed as the basis for demonstrations
and classwork for almost every software development technology that you can work with, from databases through devices.
All participants can identify with the cafe scenario and have a feel for how it must work.
The core environment is kept simple: products, employees, and customers.

# TC3-Database-SQLite3

## History

2019-10-05 - Original release.<br>
2020-10-14 - Simplified the database, the original real-world schema was far too complicated for examples.

## Overview
There are two versions of the SQLite3 database included, and two SQL scripts.
The tc3-core.db contains just the schema with employee types populated, built from the tc3-sqlite3-schema.sql script.

tc3-sample-data.db has 25 employees, 100 customers, 35 products, and 300 sales orders, 
added by running the tc3-sqlite3-sample-data.sql script after creating the tables from tc3-sqlite3-schema.sql.

To level-set, this is a fundamental database implementation with customers, employees, and products
that is intended to be used as a basis for writing server-side and client-side applications.
The tables are basic,
the purpose is to use this database in teaching environments where participants should not be overwhelmed with
field after field of unnecessary data.
The fundamental concepts are all here to work with: multiple related tables, natural vs surrogate primary keys,
foreign key relationships, null vs zero, stored vs calculated data, etc.
It is not a perfect design, on purpose to teach with.

Customers and employees do not have addresses, telephone numbers, or any extra data like that to
keep it simple.
Sales orders have stored totals to contrast stored vs calculated results.
Customer passwords are random and in clear text, recorded credit card numbers for transactions
are in clear text.
Issues like these offer opportunities to introduce and develop security concepts for databases and
application programs.
FYI: there is a line commented out in the tc3-sample-data.sql script that will mask the credit card numbers
if you want to start out with them masked.

## Project Setup

Start with a copy of the tc3-core.db file or tc3-sample-data.db file in your application.
Or, use the schema and sample SQL files
to populate a database at runtime, e.g. in a Spring boot test environment.

I recommend using SQLiteStudio ([https://sqlitestudio.pl](https://sqlitestudio.pl)) to explore the database.
And, there are plenty of other products out there, including SQLite from [https://sqlite.org](https://sqlite.org) itself, for you to choose from.

## Related Projects

Of course every project in https://github.com/tc3-project is related in some manner,
but you may want to take a closer look at
https://github.com/tc3-project/tc3-product-images.
There you will find images for the products to use in applications, and scripts to add the images
to the SQLite3 database as blobs an application may query.
